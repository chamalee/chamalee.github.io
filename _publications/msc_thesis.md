In this master’s thesis, I study the max–min SINR optimization problem for uplink transmission in a cell-free massive MIMO system. The algorithm optimizes both transmit power and weighting coefficients in a centralized unit using an iterative alternating method where weight optimization is solved via a generalized eigenvalue problem, and power allocation is handled using geometric programming. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
